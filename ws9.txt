US	51698265	R3RKCKK4BZJQNT	0345418492	363142208	A Spell for Chameleon: (#1) (Xanth)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wow!  A fantasy novel adults can enjoy!	I tried reading this book when I was about 10 years old.  It didn't capture my attention then, and I put it aside.  I tried it again now, on a whim, and boy did I like it!  I believe it's more angled towards adults than towards children, and I appreciated it more now.The story is very  entertaining with some impressive plot twists.  Every character had its own  set of adult fears to face, which is what I think made this book  interesting.  Although this book seemed based more on human emotion than  anything else (Trent's insecurities and Bink's disappointment with the life  he knew) it had some neat fantasy/scifi references I appreciated (did this  book take place in Earth's future?  Where did the Mundanes come from?)In  short, I hadn't read a fantasy novel for well over a decade, but Piers  Anthony has stirred my interest in them again.	2000-04-25

Like a good teacher, Kreeft has a knack for using just the right analogy to explain a thorny question. Vivid problems vividly pondered. While not an exhaustive philosophical treatise, it's a fine book for most of us common folk, presenting many  problems you will face in your daily life.	2000-02-04
